evolight

An evolutionary algorithm that smooths color gradients and blink patterns. 
curses_demo: Python and Curses. This code will act as proof of concept and precursor to a physical object with similar properties.

To run curses-based demo, run:

% cd curses_demo
% python interface.py

Curses demo requires a curses color compliant terminal to run properly. As of this writing, only iTerm on MacOS X is compliant. Tough.
